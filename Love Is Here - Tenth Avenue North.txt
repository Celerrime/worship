G#m	     B	    E			      G#m	    B E
Come to the Water, you who thirst and you’ll thirst no more

Come to the Father, you who work and you’ll work no more


(Pre-chorus)

And all you who labor in vain, and to the broken and shamed:

Love is here, Love is now
	G#m	          F#		E

Come to the treasure, you who search and you’ll search no more

Come to the Lover, you who want and you’ll want no more


(Bridge)
E
And to the bruised and fallen,
B/D#
Captives bound and broken hearted…
C#m	        F#
He is the Lord. He is the Lord.
E
By His stripes He’s paid our ransom,
B/D#
From His wounds we drink salvation
C#m		F#		F#
He is the Lord, He is the Lord.
